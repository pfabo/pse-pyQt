* open-source project released under the GNU-GPL 
* exclusive use of a homogeneous multi-platform infrastructure of Python programming language
* simple and intuitive internal structure of the editor allowing its easy extension and modification 
* single bond to the host operating system through standard Python library system allowing the diagrams 
  to interact with its environment (eg. integration of measuring and laboratory equipment)  
  and communication via the Internet 
* the possibility of using scripts in the actual diagrams, creating dynamic models and the dynamic 
  changes in the parameters of components using the adaptive simulation tools.
